This project is based on angular-seed skeleton.

# To run this on local environment, you need to have Java7, node, npm, bower installed.
# Project dependencies can be installed by running npm install command in same directory which contains package.json
# UI can be started by running npm start (in same directory as package.json)
# UI can be accessd on URL : http://localhost:400/app/#
# In case port 4000 is in use, causing a conflict, port can be changed in package.json
